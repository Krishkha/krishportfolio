  title: "About Me",
  desc: "My name is Krish Khatikar, a Integrated M.SC. IT graduate from Silver Oak University, with a strong passion for frontend and mobile development. I specialize in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React Native, ReactJS, and Tailwind CSS. I bring 10 months of hands-on experience as a React Native Developer, which includes a 6-month internship and 4 months as a full-time developer. During this time, I successfully designed, developed, and maintained high-performance mobile applications for Android. Recently, I’ve been transitioning from mobile development to web development with ReactJS, as I enjoy building seamless and responsive user interfaces for the web. This shift has allowed me to expand my skill set, deepen my understanding of frontend architecture, and work on more versatile web-based solutions.I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional teams, but I’m equally comfortable working independently. With a fast-learning mindset, strong attention to detail, and a commitment to writing clean, efficient code, I’m excited to contribute to impactful web projects and continue growing as a frontend developer.",
